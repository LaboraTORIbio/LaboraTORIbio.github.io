## [GH Archive ETL](https://github.com/AlmudenaZhou/data-engineer-gharchive)

Through leveraging data from GH Archive, I've developed an Extract, Transform, Load (**ETL**) pipeline to clean raw data, insert it into a centralized **data lake**, and process it into a structured **data warehouse** for analysis. The pipeline handles both **batch processing** for historical data and **real-time hourly updates**. By implementing this pipeline, I aimed to provide improved **insights into GitHub activity** while ensuring **data reliability** and facilitating future advanced **analytics**. 

<u><b>Tools</b></u>: **Python**, **Git**, **Pyspark/Apache Spark 3**, **Google Cloud**(Cloud Run, Google Cloud Storage, Google BigQuery), **Terraform**, **Mage Orchestrator**, **Looker Studio**

## [Factories Pygame Boardgame](https://github.com/AlmudenaZhou/Factories-PygameBoardGame)

I refactored an old game I developed years ago, leveraging **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and the **MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern**. This transformation not only improved performance but also enhanced scalability and flexibility for future updates.

The game challenges players to dominate the board strategically by purchasing resources. Available in both **Spanish and English**, it supports multiplayer modes for **two players or solo play against AI**. Dive in to explore this project!

<u><b>Tools</b></u>: **Python**, **venv**
